# Final project "School department"

## Installation ##
___
Python 3.7+ is required to run code from this repo.

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/stupns/school-app
$ cd school-app
```

Now let's install the requirements. But before we do that, we strongly recommend creating a virtual environment with a tool such as virtualenv:
```console
$ virtualenv -p python3 .venv
$ source .venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
